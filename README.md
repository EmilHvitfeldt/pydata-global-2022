Machine learning operations (MLOps) are often synonymous with large and complex applications, but many MLOps practices help practitioners build better models, regardless of the size. This talk shares best practices for operationalizing a model and practical examples using the open-source MLOps framework `vetiver` to version, share, deploy, and monitor models.
